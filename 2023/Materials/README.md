# Source code for article in journal Materials (WIP)

This repository contains the source code used to create the Figures published in the Materials journal article entitled "Optical Characterization of Thin Films︎ by Surface Plasmon Resonance Spectroscopy Using an Acousto-Optic Tunable Filter". The code is written in Python and uses the NumPy and Matplotlib libraries.

This repository contains the source codes used  for the publication of the article in journal Materials.


## Getting Started

To run the code, you will need to have Python 3 and the NumPy and Matplotlib libraries installed on your computer. You can install them by running the following command:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
or with conda:
```
conda create --name <env> --file conda_requirements.txt
```


## TODO
