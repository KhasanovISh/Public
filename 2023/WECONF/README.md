## Abstract
The method to reconstruct an approximate form of the optical profile of thin gradient films using their approximation by polynomial functions is presented. The proposed approach is based on experimental spectral and angular measurements of reflected quasimonochromatic p-polarized light after filtering by an acoustooptic tunable filter. Measurements are made by surface plasmon resonance for a thin gold film with a refractive index gradient dielectric coating on a prism in Kretschmann geometry. The established wavelength dispersion of the resonance angle makes it possible to select the type of optical profile using a set of functions representing a polynomial sequence. To select the type of polynomial approximating the true optical profile, it is proposed to perform an additional measurement when the surface of the thin film is in contact with a non-reactive liquid.
